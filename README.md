# Website Analysis Dashoard

*Overview*

I recently developed an interactive Website Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, which provides insights into user behavior, purchase trends, and marketing effectiveness. This dashboard was created to help businesses understand their audience and optimize their strategies based on data-driven decisions.


**Data Cleaning & Preparation**

Before diving into visualization, I ensured that the data was clean and structured for accurate analysis. Key steps included:
Handling missing values
Standardizing categorical variables
Creating calculated columns for better insights


**Key Insights & Analysis**

1. User Demographics & Purchase Behavior

a) The total number of users tracked: 9,240
b) Total purchases made: 3,561
c) Average time spent before purchase: 739 minutes
d) Average visits before making a purchase: 4
e) Majority of purchases were made by Unemployed individuals (2.4K purchases), followed by Working Professionals (0.6K purchases).


2. Geographical Insights

a) The highest number of purchases came from India (6.5K purchases).
b) A significant portion of purchases was categorized as 'Unknown' (2.5K purchases), indicating potential data gaps or untracked location data.
c) Other countries such as the United States and UAE had minimal purchase activity.


3. Marketing & Communication Preferences

a) 50% of users who opted out of email communication still proceeded with purchases.
b) 33% of users who selected "Do Not Call" still engaged in purchasing behavior.
c) The most effective acquisition channels included Lead Import (22%), Landing Page Submission (22%), and Lead Add Forms (22%).


4. Purchase Trends by Specialization

a) The highest number of purchases was recorded in categories like Supply Chain Management, IT Projects Management, Media & Advertising, and Healthcare Management.
b) This indicates strong demand in technology, healthcare, and logistics-related fields.


**Recommendations**

a) Based on the data insights, I recommend:
b) Optimizing digital marketing efforts for users marked as "Unknown" to better track their origins.
c) Improving communication strategies as a significant portion of users who opted out of email/call communication still made purchases.
d) Targeted promotions for working professionals to increase engagement in that segment.
e) Geographical expansion strategies focusing on India while improving visibility in the U.S. and UAE markets.



**Conclusion**

This dashboard showcases my ability to work with complex datasets, draw actionable insights, and create meaningful visualizations. If you’re interested in discussing data analysis and business intelligence further, feel free to connect with me!

# Call Center Dashboard 

**Overview**
I recently had the opportunity to analyze call center performance data, leveraging Power BI for visualization. Here’s a glimpse into my process and the insights I uncovered:

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
Before diving into analysis, I ensured the dataset was clean and ready for visualization. This step was crucial for accurate analysis and smooth integration into Power BI.


**Step 2: Key Metrics and Insights**
Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard highlighting key metrics such as:

a)Average Satisfaction Rate: Tracks overall customer satisfaction.
b)Average Speed of Answer: Measures how quickly calls are answered.
c)Average Talk Time: Indicates the average duration of calls.
d)Satisfaction Rating by Agent: Shows individual agent performance.
e)Call Count by Month: Provides a monthly breakdown of call volumes.
f)Resolved Calls by Topic: Breaks down call resolution by categories like contract-related, streaming, and technical support.


**Key Insights**

a)Agent Performance: Jim has the highest number of answered calls and satisfaction ratings, indicating strong performance.
b)Call Resolution: Streaming and technical support are the most common issues resolved.
c)Monthly Trends: Call volumes remain stable with minor fluctuations.

**Recommendations**

a)Training: Provide additional training for agents with lower satisfaction ratings.
b)Resource Allocation: Ensure adequate staffing during peak call times.
c)Process Improvement: Streamline processes for common issues to reduce talk time.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to showcase my Power BI skills and deliver actionable insights. The dashboard not only looks great but also provides valuable information for decision-making.
